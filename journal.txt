every now and then you want to create a real commit. Git-jrnl creates a new commit on the non-journal branch and a commit on the journal branch with both the real commit and the journal commit as the parents. In this way you can choose to keep the journal private, or clean it up before pushing. (9ff3862) (713de05)# Sat Sep  6 15:51:13 WEDT 2014
